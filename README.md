# lift-using-verilog

This project implements a 4-floor elevator (lift) controller using a Finite State Machine (FSM) in Verilog. The elevator supports 4 floors:
Ground Floor (0)
First Floor (1)
Second Floor (2)
Third Floor (3)
The lift moves based on the requested floor input (datain), and the controller lights up the corresponding floor indicator.
